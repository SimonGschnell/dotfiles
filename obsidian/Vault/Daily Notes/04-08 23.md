# In-memory database (redis)

Redis is an in-memory database,
it stores all of the database information in the main memory (RAM) to be very fast, because storing data to disk is slower.

**BUT** main memory is volatile, which means when the server shuts off also all the data in the main memory is **lost**. This is prevented by saving all the database operations on disk as a transaction logs.

**BUT WHAT ABOUT UPDATES ?**
well updates (let's call it a transaction) have also to be applied to the disk, does that slow down the process?

Not really because logs are stored sequentially on the disk. An HDD can write to the end of a file as fast as 100 Mbytes per second

`On the other hand, they’re utterly slow when you use them randomly. They can normally complete around 100 random operations per second.`

*This tremendous 6-order-of-magnitude difference between the worst case scenario (100 bytes per second) and the best case scenario (100,000,000 bytes per second) of disk access speed is based on the fact that, in order to seek a random sector on disk, a physical movement of a disk head has occurred, while you don’t need it for sequential access as you just read data from disk as it spins, with a disk head being stable.*

# FZF 
fuzzy finding - is a great cli tool that let's you easily change into another directory by pressing `ALT+C` and searching the target with strings that are close to the target.

OR find and reuse old commands with 
`CTRL + R` where you can fuzzy find the old command once used

OR finally, you can use fzf to paste a directory in the bash with `CTRL + T` which is useful when opening a file with vim and the file might be in some random location.

example : `vim CTRL + T 

you can also open fzf by appending 2 \** at the end of the command like.

cd ~/\** and it will open fuzzy finding from the home directory.
