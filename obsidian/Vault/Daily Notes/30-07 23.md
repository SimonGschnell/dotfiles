#database/sqllite
# sqllite
is an in-process database, which means that the Database management system runs on the local system. One should see sqllite as a fopen replacement, for storing information on the own/local machine. 

**`Best suited for embedded systems`**

#database/redis

# [[redis]] 
is an in-memory* database that can be used as a cache, for example when querying an expensive data set from the main database, you might want to consider caching some parts that can be reused in a later moment by the user.

which saves time, instead of querying the data from the main database.

`multiple queries are sent in a pipeline, which means they can be sent simultaneously`

[[Rust]] has excellent support for the [[Redis]] database

\*in-memory => data is stored on the main memory (RAM) of the computer. This reduces the instructions the CPU has to process in order to retrieve or store the data.
