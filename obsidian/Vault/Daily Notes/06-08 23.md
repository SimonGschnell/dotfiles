The user can interact with the computer through the cli with `text commands`.

# Terminal
The terminal is the graphical user interface (GUI) of the [[06-08 23#CLI]]. There are many different terminal applications for different linux distributions. My current terminal is the Xfce Terminal. Other newer terminals like the [[Warp]] terminal that have integrated AI help with auto-completion and mouse actions on shell blocks.

# Shell
The shell is the interpreting software that reads the commands from the user and translates them to os system-calls. There are numerous shells on the market. The most famous shell is the burn against shell (BASH) which is the default shell for the most [[linux distributions]].
Other shells like the [[Zsh]] is backwards compatible with the bash and has some additional features on top, it is a superset of the shell. The Fish shell is not backwards compatible but has new features and more customization options.
