## docker_volume && bind
Often, our applications produce data that we need to safely persist (e.g. database data, user uploaded data, etc...) even if the containers are destroyed and recreated. Luckily, Docker (and containers more generally) have a feature to handle this use case called `Volumes` and `mounts`!

`Volumes` and `mounts` allow us to specify a location where data should persist beyond the lifecycle of a single container. The data can live in a location managed by Docker (`volume mount`), a location in your host filesystem (`bind mount`), or in memory (`tmpfs mount`, not pictured).

## how to use docker-volume
`create a named volume`

```bash
#creates volume in the docker engine 
docker volume create simons_volume
```

`Create a container and mount the volume into the container filesystem`

```bash
docker run  -it --rm --mount source=simons_volume,destination=/my-data/ ubuntu:22.04
```

`There is a similar (but shorter) syntax using -v which accomplishes the same`

```shell
docker run  -it --rm -v simons_volume:/my-data ubuntu:22.04
```


`Now we can create and store the file into the location we mounted the volume`

```shell
echo "Hello from the container!" > /my-data/hello.txt
cat my-data/hello.txt
exit
```

`If we mount the same volume to another container, we will be able to see the created hello.txt file`
