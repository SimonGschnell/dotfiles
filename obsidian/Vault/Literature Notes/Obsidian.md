Is a software that keeps track of your notes and creates a graph of them, that can be connected to each other.

The graph keeps track of what the user has taken notes of and what he might want to explore in the future.

Users can activate vim motions in the settings, to write and edit their notes.

The notes should support markdown text to highlight the content of the notes.

example:
```rust
main(){
let name = "Simon";
println!("hi how are you {}",name);
}
```

Obsidian can be used with [[vim motions]] to navigate and edit pages, this setting is not default active but has to be activated in the settings.
