# formatting
to create a `new note` in obsidian, type ctrl + n
`italic` => ctrl + i (*test*)
`bold` => ctrl + b (**test**)
`underscore` => works like * (__underline__) 
`highlight text` => \`text\` `test`
`checkboxes` => ctrl + l
- [ ] test
- [ ] adsfa

# Links

`links to websites` => ctrl + k => [Link](https://www.google.com) (don't forget the https://)

`links to pages` =>
**links** are very particular aspects of obsidian, a link can be created with the double square brackets => [[]]
every link will create a dynamically generated new page where you can describe the topic of the link. you can also link already existing obsidian pages with a nice looking auto-completion.

 
# headings
## heading2
### heading3

`headings` => #

**link** to a specific *header* => [[headings#heading3]]
reuse content of a link => ![[]]
![[headings#heading2]]

`reuse content` of a specific paragraph in a link => ^ inside [[]]
![[headings#^58e09a]]
[[headings#^3ad940]]

# hashtags

`hashtag` => #hashtag
(different between the heading, there is no space between the # and the text)

Hashtags are useful to search for content that is spread in different notes for example you could have ideas about a topic in some daily notes and then label it with a topic hashtag.

afterwards you could search these bits of texts through the search function looking for that particular hashtag and quote the text into a more formal document with the ![[]] syntax

-- DON'T create general hashtags instead they should be categories with intent

you can create subcategories with the / in the hashtag like this => #hashtag/test1 or #hashtag/test2
where the main hashtag is the principle topic and it is followed by the subcategory

# images
The command to insert a screenshot into obsidian is the same as for using the content of a link. The pasted images will be saved in a separate folder that can be specified in the settings.

`screenshot` => 
![[ali.png]]
